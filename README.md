# Train-Scheduler
Assignment #7
https://dstark88.github.io/Train-Scheduler/

With this assignment we needed to use Firebase for data storage for the information entered. We then ran a call to moment.js for keeping up with the time the train ran and when they would arrive next.  

Future fixes would be to make there a way to delete or edit entries.
Have the remaining minutest auto update as the time counts down.
